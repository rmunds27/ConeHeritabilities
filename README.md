# ConeHeritabilities
Code analysis exploring the L:M and S:(L+M) cone ratios in macaques

There are three sets of data four types of coding to explore. 

Exploratory cone ratio variation is done using the code sets "ConeRatioFigure_RCode" or the "TimeofDaycode". The datasets associated with these codes are "ddPCR_Data.CSV" and "TOD.csv"

Details on pedigree analyses and heritability analyses are found in the "ConeRatioHeritability_MasterRCode" and using the "PedigreeData_2022"
